User Story
As a User, I want to search a movie title in Netflix and have it return the Movie Title and description.
I also want the movie search to return a chili recipe with an image, ingredients, and directions.
I would also like a list of past recipes I have searched to use again if I want.
This way, I can have a delicious chili to eat while I watch a great movie.
